# Traekka Website - Next.js 13 + Tailwind CSS 2 + TypeScript 4

Welcome to the source code of the Traekka website! Our site is built with the latest technologies because we love technology. We use Next.js 13 as our static site generator, Tailwind CSS 2 for styling, and TypeScript 4 for added type safety. It is deployed to Vercel or Azure Web Apps.

Our website is available at [traekka.com](https://traekka.com), where you can learn more about our company and the services we offer. But that's not all - our project also serves as a showcase for Next.js projects! We invite you to use it as a boilerplate and quick start for your own projects.
